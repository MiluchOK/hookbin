# hookbin
This project inspired by [requestb.in](http://requestb.in) and [inspectb.in](http://inspectb.in) was created to
support our automation strategy at [FitPay](http://www.fit-pay.com).   RequestBin and InspectBin our awesome tools,
but we needed something just a little bit more, tailored towards QA automation.

At this point there is no UI for hookbin, it's an API driven project.  If somebody were so inspired to provide 
for a UI on top of the API... well that would be awesome.

In the spirit of an API driven strategy:
